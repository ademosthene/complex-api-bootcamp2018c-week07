## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Meal and Wikipedia APIs.

This project was written in JavaScript using the fetch method to access the Meals Database. When a user clicks 'new recipe', the API returns the name and photo of a new recipe to try. The category this meal is classified under is then passed through the Wikipedia API to search. This returns a fact about the food category to the user. This project was designed using CSS3.

## Lessons Learned:

This project furthered my understanding of complex API structures.
